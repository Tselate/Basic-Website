        <h4>Purpose</h4>  
        <p>The purpose of education is to yield collaboration among individuals, collaboration through critical dialogue (see Pedagogy of the Oppressed) with each other. Such collaboration shall lead individuals to understand their environment, transform their environment (if they wish to do so) and to flourish (to grow and thrive) in their environment. Critical dialogue can be considered a dialogue fueled by analysis of a topic, its context, its effects, etc. This analysis is supplemented by experience and uses the process of inquiry (see Dewey 1916) to conclude on this topic. This topic of discussion can range anywhere from healthy foods to the best political regime to morality, it can be anything the participants of this dialogue wish it to be. The number of participates in this dialogue is not capped at a certain amount (as long as the dialogue is carried out in a manner that allows for the participation of all); rather the minimum requirement is two participants. This critical dialogue, if carried out correctly, shall induces reflection on the part of the participants. This is so because this dialogue is supplemented by the experience of the participants. As the experience of the participants is brought into this critical dialogue, it will be examined through a different perspective, the perspective of the other participant(s). This examination will induce a reflection from the participant who went through the experience, which will produce a better understanding of the experience and its context (environment) for the individual. This reflection can also be induced on the group level. Through better understanding their environment, human beings will have the ability to flourish in it. As they will better understand the components of their environment, they will be able to work through their environment and flourish in that environment. Furthermore, if human beings come to understand they are unable to truly flourish in their environment, then they have the ability to transform it. Through the process of inquiry, human beings have the ability to find the best solution for the issue that is restricting them from flourishing in their current environment. With this solution, they can transform their environment. </p>

        <h4>Aim</h4>
        <p>In order to fulfill its purpose, the aim of education should be to aid individuals in becoming the best of who they are as valuable members of their community, who understand their reality through acting as autonomous agents who come to their understanding through the process of inquiry. Individuals become the best of who they are when they reach their potential of valuably contributing to their community through their own individuality, their perspective. Each individual brings a different perspective. With different perspectives come different solutions to the same problem. In the sense that individuals can actively contribute their own perspective, while engaging in critical dialogue with others they become a valuable asset to their community. It must be noted here that an individual does not belong to only one community in the world; rather an individual is a member of different communities around the world. These communities for the individual maybe related or totally separate and the degree of engagement may vary, but the important fact is that the individual is a part of many communities in the world. These different communities constitute different aspects of the individual’s identity, but what constitutes the identity of an individual, as a whole, is his or her own individuality not these communities. The individual’s identity is influenced to an extent by his or her communities but not exhausted by these communities. An individual is not an individual because he or she is a member of the community, but rather he or she is a member because they are an individual. An individual, as a member of a community becomes valuable when they present their own individual perspective, which they have formed through their interactions. An individual’s personal experience fuels their past, present and future understanding of reality. Individuals construct their understanding of the environment through their experiences. Experience can be conceived as the mental and physical interaction individuals have with their environment and the people around them. The experiences individuals undergo shape their perspectives, but what ultimately constitutes the perspective of an individual is how they reflect upon the experience and the conclusion they reach based on that reflection. It is also through experience that individuals generate knowledge, through the process of inquiry (see Dewey 1916). When individuals undergo a new experience, they have the opportunity to learn something new through reflection and action. This process of inquiry (although best completed collectively) allows individuals to become autonomous agents in their learning process. By combining their perspective with the process of inquiry, individuals generate their own understanding of reality.  
        </p>

        <h4 class="aim-section">Valuable Member </h4>
        <p>Individuals can valuably contribute to their communities through their individually critical, cosmopolitan and respectful perspectives (see “An African Theory of the Point of Higher Education: Communion as an Alternative to Autonomy, Truth, and Citizenship”).  A critical individual is one who is analytical in every situation. They do not blindly accept their observations or the information they receive from others to be the whole truth. They try to approach situations and ideas from different perspectives and they question and analyze before accepting anything into their understanding. A cosmopolitan individual is one who is concerned and knowledgeable about many different communities and countries in the world. They are at ease when they encounter new cultures and eager to learn and experience new things. As they know about the different communities of the world and they too are a part these different communities (to a certain extent), they show concern for all people and their communities. They do not operate from their own self-interest, rather the interests of all people (or at least the people of all the communities they know of). A respectful individual is one who has due regard for all individuals on the basis that they are human beings. They respect all, without discrimination based on sex, creed, race, etc. The only way an individual would lose the respect from another is by dehumanizing and disrespecting another individual. By having a critical, cosmopolitan and respectful individual perspective, individuals become valuable members of their communities, who can valuably contribute through critical dialogue. </p>

        <h4 class="aim-section">Autonomous Learning </h4>
        <p>Going through the process of inquiry (see Dewey 1916) while undergoing a new experience, individuals come to learn new things. In this process of inquiry, individuals problem solve. They solve problems by reflecting upon their newly encountered problem, studying its conditions and coming up with a solution based on reasoning. Through this process, individuals have the ability to solve any problem they may encounter, and have the ability to learn from every experience they undergo. They are autonomous agents in their learning. By being autonomous agents in their learning, individuals will not be heavily influenced by the opinions or perspectives of others. This will promote a truly individual perspective form students. </p>
        <h4 class="aim-section">Understanding reality </h4>
        <p>Through combining their individual perspective with the process of inquiry, individuals will be able to come up with their own understanding of reality. Since experience is what fuels the understanding of reality, each individual’s understanding of reality may vary to a certain extent. This variation in the understanding of reality shall not lead to disorder among individuals and communities but rather a better understanding of the collective reality. Through engaging in critical dialogue, individuals have the opportunity to present their individuals understanding of reality and perception of their environment. By sharing their individuals understanding of reality and collectively analyzing and reflecting upon their understandings, individuals can illuminate different aspects of reality for each other. Through this process, individuals will come to better understand their reality and will have the ability to understand how they can flourish in their environment or why they are not flourishing. If they are not flourishing, they can combine their different understandings of reality and analyze it from different angles in order to find the problem. After finding the issue, individuals can collectively, through the process of inquiry, come to solve the problem and transform their environment. </p>

        <h4>Method </h4>
        <p>
        Education shall aid individuals by cultivating the nature that already exists in them, guiding individuals towards the maturing of their different qualities. The three most important qualities are positivity, open-mindedness, and empathy. Introducing the process of inquiry and the idea of action and reflection, education shall promote students to learn on their own. While promoting autonomous learning, education shall provide guided experiences in which students shall do their own learning. These guided experiences should strive to mature the three qualities mentioned above. Guided experience combined with reflection leads to the maturity of these qualities.


        <h4 class="aim-section">Positivity</h4>
        As a mature positive individual, who is focused on the present and persevering, as well as optimistic, individuals will tackle all of the problems they might face in the world head on. Positively looking at the bright side and being optimistic, individuals will not get discouraged by the problems they face and always look for a better solution. Although appreciating the past and the experiences gained from it, the focus of the positive individual is that on the present. This appreciation for the past but focus on the present will promote positive individuals in understanding the present as connected to the past but also different. In this sense, they must understand that the problems of the present cannot be solved by the solutions of the past. Although they may use the experience of the past, positive individuals are ones who seek present solutions for the present problems. 
        Positive individuals do not blindly follow the solutions that are passed down on to them. They are always looking for a better way of working through things. Always in search for a better solution, while looking back at the past but focusing on the present, positive individuals will become critical in their thinking.  
        
        <h4 class="aim-section">Open-mindedness</h4>
        Mature open-minded individuals are ones who appreciate difference and see the value in difference. Open-minded individuals like to try new things and gain new experiences. As they have had many different experiences and they understand that difference is something that can be found anywhere and between many things. They are ones who understand that difference is not something bad but rather an elucidation of uniqueness and a different perspective. For those who are open-minded difference does not symbolize threat. Human beings tend to fear or feel threated by what they do not know. In this sense, if something is different, then it would be threatening or will induce fear. Open-minded people have the ability to get over such fear through the understanding that difference does not always present threat, rather a new set of solutions and perspectives. They also appreciate and respect difference. They appreciate the fact that individuals coming from different backgrounds bring different experiences, which have shaped their different perspectives. They show respect to difference through this appreciation. By appreciating each additional perspective on an issue or topic, and not disregarding any perspective based on where it stems from, the open-minded individual demonstrates that they respect difference. 
        As open-minded individuals are always excited to learn about a new culture or undergo a new experience, they are always trying new things. By trying and experiencing new things and cultures, open-minded individuals become cosmopolitan. By encountering many different cultures and people, open-minded individuals come to appreciate the difference there is in between people. This appreciation for difference leads open-minded individuals in becoming respectful to others and the difference they represent. Furthermore, with their knowledge and experience of different cultures and things in the world and their willingness to explore, open-minded individuals have the ability to be critical.  Their willingness to try new things will bring them to new experiences and with new experiences come new knowledge and a reshaping of an individual’s perspective. This will allow open-minded individuals in fostering a critical perspective of the world. 
        
        
        <h4 class="aim-section">Empathy</h4>
        A mature empathetic individual is someone who is understanding. They have the ability to place themselves in the shoes of someone else. Due to this ability, they also have the ability to view things from different perspectives. As they are able to place themselves in the shoe of others, they are also able to view things from another’s perspective. The extent to which an individual might be able to do this varies, but if they have come to mature their quality of empathy, in the minimal sense they will try to perceive things from the perspective of the other, regardless of their ability to do so. This willingness to understand or see things from the perspective of another is an aspect of the empathetic individual. Empathetic people are empathetic due to ability to be understanding, but in order to have that ability these individuals need to also have the willingness to be empathetic and see things from different perspectives. Empathetic individuals also value experience. As experiences are what form the perspective of individual, empathetic individual value experiences. Each experience, big or small holds some kind of significance for an empathetic individual. 
        By placing themselves in the shoes of another, empathetic individuals have the ability to see thing from a different perspective. By analyzing a situation through their own lens, as well as another’s, empathetic individuals become critical.  Furthermore, by placing themselves in another’s shoes, empathetic individuals come to see the experience the person has experienced and how those experiences have influenced this individual. Empathetic individuals value experience, in this sense, by coming to understand the experience the individual they are empathizing with has undergone, they become respectful.

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Maturely positive, open-minded, and empathetic individuals are the most capable in effective collaboration with others. Individuals are naturally positive, open-minded, and emphatic, but the degree to which such qualities are fostered in these individuals vary. Therefore, education shall guide individuals in maturing these three qualities in the aims of aiding them to become the best of who they are as valuable members of their community, who understand their reality through acting as autonomous agents who come to their understanding through the process of inquiry. Through guided experience, education shall provide the environment in which individuals will mature their natural qualities, as well as introduce them to the process of inquiry. Through maturing the three qualities mentioned above, individuals will form their individually critical, cosmopolitan and respectful perspective. Furthermore, with the process of inquiry, individuals will become autonomous agents in their learning. This will provide individuals with a true individual perspective (when it comes to their reality) that is not influenced by an authoritative figure in education. Through combining their individual perspective with the process of inquiry, individuals will be able to come to their own unique understanding of reality (and their environment).  Through their critical, cosmopolitan and respectful perspective, individuals will effectively participate in critical dialogue with other individuals. Through their own understanding of reality, individuals (during critical dialogue) can illuminate to other individuals different aspects of the collective reality they all reside in. Through effectively engaging in critical dialogue and coming to a collective and better understanding of reality, individuals can flourish in their environment and if they need to do so, they can transform their environment.
